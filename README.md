# VectorRag : Adaptive Hallucination Detection Framework

A RAG-based framework for detecting, evaluating, and mitigating hallucinations in LLM-generated responses through evidence-grounded retrieval and response verification.

## Overview

Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate fluent and convincing responses that contain information that is inaccurate, unsupported, or not present in the available knowledge source. This problem, commonly referred to as **hallucination**, becomes particularly important in applications where factual reliability and evidence-based responses are required.

**VectorRAG** focuses on improving the reliability of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by introducing mechanisms to identify unsupported information in generated responses, evaluate their faithfulness against retrieved evidence, and mitigate detected hallucinations.

The system is designed around the principle that an AI-generated response should not only be relevant to a user's query, but should also be **grounded in verifiable evidence**.

## Problem Statement

Although RAG systems improve the factuality of LLMs by providing external knowledge, retrieved information does not guarantee that the final generated response is completely faithful to that information.

A response may:

* Contain claims that are not supported by the retrieved context.
* Misinterpret or distort information from the retrieved documents.
* Combine supported and unsupported information.
* Generate plausible information that is absent from the knowledge base.
* Provide an answer with high confidence despite insufficient evidence.

Therefore, there is a need for a framework that can **detect, evaluate, and mitigate hallucinations after or during the RAG generation process**.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of the project are:

1. Develop a RAG-based system capable of retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base.
2. Generate responses grounded in the retrieved evidence.
3. Detect potentially unsupported or hallucinated claims in generated responses.
4. Evaluate the faithfulness and reliability of generated responses.
5. Identify the evidence supporting individual claims.
6. Mitigate detected hallucinations through response refinement.
7. Improve the overall accuracy, faithfulness, and trustworthiness of RAG-based AI systems.

## Proposed Workflow

The overall workflow follows a retrieval, generation, verification, and refinement pipeline:

**User Query → Document Retrieval → Context Construction → LLM Response Generation → Hallucination Detection → Faithfulness Evaluation → Response Refinement → Final Response**

### 1. Query Processing

The user's query is processed and transformed into a form suitable for information retrieval.

### 2. Evidence Retrieval

Relevant information is retrieved from the available knowledge base using vector-based semantic retrieval.

### 3. Context-Aware Generation

The retrieved evidence is provided to the language model as context for generating a response.

### 4. Hallucination Detection

The generated response is analyzed to identify claims that may not be supported by the retrieved evidence.

### 5. Faithfulness Evaluation

Detected claims are evaluated against the available evidence to determine whether the response is sufficiently grounded.

### 6. Response Refinement

Unsupported or potentially hallucinated information is flagged and, where possible, the response is refined using the available evidence.

### 7. Final Response

The system produces a response that prioritizes factual consistency and evidence grounding.

## Key Features

## Why VectorRAG?

Traditional RAG systems primarily focus on retrieving relevant documents and providing them to an LLM. However, retrieval alone does not ensure that every statement in the generated answer is supported by the retrieved evidence.

This project extends the RAG workflow by treating **response verification as an essential part of the generation pipeline**.

The goal is not simply to retrieve better information, but to establish a stronger relationship between:

**Query → Evidence → Claim → Verification → Response**

This makes the system more suitable for knowledge-intensive applications where unsupported AI-generated information can have significant consequences.

## Applications

The framework can be applied to domains where reliable and evidence-grounded AI responses are important, including:

* Education and academic assistance
* Research and literature analysis
* Enterprise knowledge management
* Document-based question answering
* E-governance information systems
* Healthcare information systems
* Knowledge-intensive conversational AI
* Internal organizational knowledge bases

## Expected Outcomes

The project aims to provide a functional framework capable of:

* Detecting unsupported information in RAG-generated responses.
* Evaluating the faithfulness of generated answers.
* Identifying relationships between generated claims and retrieved evidence.
* Reducing hallucinated content through response refinement.
* Improving the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated responses.
* Providing a foundation for evaluating trustworthy RAG systems.

## Project Scope

The current scope focuses on **hallucination detection and mitigation within Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems**.

The project primarily investigates the relationship between retrieved evidence and generated responses rather than attempting to eliminate hallucinations from Large Language Models completely.

## Future Scope

Potential future extensions include:

* Claim-level hallucination scoring.
* More advanced evidence attribution.
* Multi-document evidence verification.
* Automated confidence estimation.
* Adaptive retrieval based on detected unsupported claims.
* Support for multiple LLMs and retrieval strategies.
* Benchmark-based evaluation of hallucination mitigation.
* Integration with agentic RAG systems.
* Real-time monitoring of RAG response reliability.

## Research Focus

The project explores the following research questions:

1. How effectively can unsupported claims in RAG-generated responses be detected?
2. How accurately can generated claims be evaluated against retrieved evidence?
3. Can automated verification reduce hallucinated information?
4. How does response refinement affect factual consistency and faithfulness?
5. What evaluation metrics are most suitable for measuring reliability in hallucination-aware RAG systems?
